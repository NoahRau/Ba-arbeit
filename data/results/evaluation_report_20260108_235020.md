## Main Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Precision** | 0.7679 (76.79%) |
| **Recall** | 1.0000 (100.00%) |
| **F1-Score** | 0.8687 (86.87%) |
| **Accuracy** | 0.7679 (76.79%) |
| **MCC (Matthews)** | 0.0000 |

### Interpretation

- **Precision (76.8%):** Of all matches the pipeline found, 76.8% were correct.
- **Recall (100.0%):** Of all true matches, the pipeline found 100.0%.
- **F1-Score (86.9%):** Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **MCC (0.000):** Correlation between predictions and ground truth (-1 to +1, 0 is random).
